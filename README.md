# Savoring-CUZ
Savoring CUZ" is a graphic drawing project developed based on Python's turtle library. Centered on the campus culture of Communication University of Zhejiang (CUZ), it integrates elements such as the Five-Star Red Flag, the university's motto, the school name base, and flower beds to create a campus style picture that combines visual aesthetics and cultural connotations. Adopting the idea of modular programming, the project decomposes complex graphics into independent functional modules, achieving high readability and maintainability of the code. It is a comprehensive achievement of Python basic programming and graphic drawing practice.
